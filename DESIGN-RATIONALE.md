# 🎨 Design Rationale – FitLife Studio Mobile App

## 1️⃣ Design Goal
The goal was to create a smooth and intuitive mobile booking experience where users can schedule fitness sessions in minimal steps.

## 2️⃣ Mobile-First Approach
The layout was designed specifically for mobile screens (iPhone 14 frame) to ensure clarity, accessibility, and easy tap interaction.

## 3️⃣ Color System
- Dark Blue: Represents trust and professionalism.
- Orange: Used for primary call-to-action buttons.
- Light Grey Background: Improves readability and reduces visual strain.

## 4️⃣ User Flow Strategy
The booking process follows a clear sequence:
Service Selection → Trainer Selection → Date & Time → Confirmation → Success.
This reduces cognitive load and improves task completion rate.

## 5️⃣ Visual Hierarchy
Important elements such as buttons and booking details are emphasized using size, color contrast, and spacing.

## 6️⃣ Interaction Design
Active states (selected date/time) are visually distinguished using the brand accent color to improve usability and clarity.
